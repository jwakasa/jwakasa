## 📝 About Me

I'm a founding engineer with a strong focus on building product-driven teams and software from the ground up.  
Having worked in fast-paced startups and fintech 🏦, I thrive in 0→1 environments where speed, iteration, and ownership matter.  
From backend to frontend to platform ops, I love solving real problems and shipping features that deliver value 🚀
